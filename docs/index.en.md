## General RDM

FAIRagro is mainly concerned with subject-specific RDM for the agricultural sciences. Here you can find some good links for reading general (generic) RDM content:

- [Forschungsdaten.info](https://forschungsdaten.info/) (german)  
	Forschungsdaten.info offers a very comprehensive, good overview with many further links to generic RDM content.
	The content is equally useful for beginners and advanced users.
	The most pages are only available in German, but there ist a [slimmed-down version in English](https://forschungsdaten.info/english-pages/).
- [RDMkit Elixir Europe](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org)  
	RDMkit from Elixir Europe offers good RDM content on generic and specialised topics in the life sciences and is aimed at a more advanced audience.
	The navigation takes some getting used to, but there is a good full-text search function.
- [Data Management Expert Guide (DMEG)](https://dmeg.cessda.eu)  
	XXX
- [Research Data Management - Information Platform for Max Planck Researchers by MPDL](https://rdm.mpdl.mpg.de)  
	MPDL offers a good overview of generic topics for beginners and advanced users.
	The content contains a lot of general information, e.g. on data management plans (DMPs) and electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), but there is also Max-Planck-specific content.
- [FAIR Data Austria](https://fair-office.at/lernen-sie-mehr/?lang=en)
