# Guideline Project Planning

Datamanagementplan, Examles: [DataPlan](https://www.nfdi4plants.de/dataplan) or [RDMO](https://rdmo.aip.de), with a good and short overview also [DMP Guide (USDA)](https://www.nal.usda.gov/data/data-management-plan-guidance)

If you do not need this for financial partners, you are quite free in the design and can freely determine the level of detail.

Questions that you can be clear about can include:

- What data do I need and where do I get it from? Can I reuse it?
- Which tools do I want to use to analyse the data, where do I store preliminary data?
- Which data do I want to generate finally? Where can I publish it (repository)? Will they be found there by the community (links from repo to repo are possible)? Are there any restrictions, e.g. personal data? Which licence do I grant? (short overview: [https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/))
- Which model should I use?

Here it is worth looking at what is widespread in the community, freely available and easy to describe.

Can/will I create a geo-reference, e.g. in the [BonaRes repo](https://maps.bonares.de/mapapps/resources/apps/bonares/index.html?lang=en)?

For further repo recommendations, see also [‘Repositories’](data_repositories.de.md) here in our knowledgebase.
