# Agriculture-specific RDM

FAIRagro mainly deals with subject-specific FDM for the agricultural sciences.
For general questions you will find [here](/knowledgebase/en/basics/) a few good links for reading general (generic) RDM content.

On the following pages you will find information on [agricultural-specific data types](specific_data) and their special features, as well as on the selection of a suitable [repository](data_repositories).
There is also a guide to the [FAIR publication of code](fair_code).
