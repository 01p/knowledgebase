# Where to find a fitting repository?

Repositories (repos) are the key places in RDM where well-described data can be stored permanently – and the place where scientists can search for data for reuse.
In addition to repos that accommodate all types of data and institutional repos, there are a large number of subject-specific repos that are often very well designed for the respective data structure and can therefore offer advantages for publication and reuse of data. 

This list (see [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11144471)) is intended to provide an overview of repos relevant to agrosystem research by listing them and presenting their domain, as well as special features and possible licenses. 

_For which target groups is the repository list intended?_  
The repo list is primarily aimed at researchers in the agrosystem community who are looking for subject-specific data publication opportunities and/or suitable data sources.
Various domains of agrosystem research are taken into account, such as plant research, genetics, soil data and geodata. 

_How are the repos described?_  
The list is divided into: unrestricted and partially restricted access.
Within these two blocks, the order of the repos is based primarily on the respective domain, as well as on whether or not a [FAIRsharing DOI](https://fairsharing.org/) and/or an entry in [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) is available.

Furthermore, each repo has a short description, lists type of resources, as well as information on possible licenses and special features.
